# Service Stability Implementation Report

**Report Date:** $(date)  
**Implementation:** Critical Service Stabilization

## Stabilization Results

### Fixed Services Status
- ðŸ”„ **mysql-exporter-production**: Still stabilizing
- ðŸ”„ **threat-intelligence**: Still stabilizing
- ðŸ”„ **security-monitor**: Still stabilizing
- âœ… **wazuh-manager**: Stabilized and running
- ðŸ”„ **ml-analytics**: Still stabilizing
- âœ… **grafana**: Stabilized and running
- âœ… **zabbix-web**: Stabilized and running

## Implementations Applied

### Phase 1: Configuration Fixes
- MySQL Exporter: Simplified authentication configuration
- Threat Intelligence: Ultra-minimal implementation without problematic dependencies
- Security Monitor: Lightweight monitoring with reduced resource requirements

### Phase 2: Resource Optimization
- Disk cleanup and space management
- Container resource limit adjustments
- Memory optimization for heavy services

### Phase 3: Automation Enhancement
- Health recovery automation with 10-minute monitoring cycles
- Automated restart loop detection and intervention
- Service dependency health checking

## Recommendations

1. **Continue Monitoring**: Services may take additional time to fully stabilize
2. **Resource Scaling**: Consider increasing system resources for heavy ML services
3. **Dependency Management**: Implement enhanced service startup sequencing
4. **Performance Tuning**: Fine-tune container resource allocations based on usage patterns
