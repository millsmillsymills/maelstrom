# 🚀 Monitoring Stack Activation Guide

## Quick Start Checklist (5 minutes)

### 1. Enable Automated Operations
```bash
# Add automated tasks to crontab
crontab -e

# Copy these lines:
*/15 * * * * /home/mills/collections/scripts/health-check-cron.sh
*/30 * * * * /home/mills/collections/scripts/monitor-log-sizes.sh
0 1 * * * /home/mills/collections/scripts/rotate-logs.sh
0 2 * * * /home/mills/collections/scripts/backup-cron.sh
0 3 * * 0 /home/mills/collections/scripts/deep-cleanup.sh
```

### 2. Secure Your System
```bash
# View generated secure passwords
cat /home/mills/collections/security/credentials.txt

# Configure firewall (if you have sudo access)
sudo /home/mills/collections/security/scripts/configure-firewall.sh

# Test security monitoring
/home/mills/collections/security/scripts/security-monitor.sh
```

### 3. Test Core Functions
```bash
# Run comprehensive health check
/home/mills/collections/scripts/simple-health-check.sh

# Create first backup
/home/mills/collections/backup/monitoring-stack-backup.sh

# Test log rotation
/home/mills/collections/scripts/rotate-logs.sh
```

### 4. Access Your Dashboards
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3000 (admin/[see credentials.txt])
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090
- **Alertmanager**: http://localhost:9093

## Daily Operations Dashboard

### Morning Checklist (2 minutes)
```bash
# Quick status overview
/home/mills/collections/scripts/stack-status.sh

# Check for any issues
docker-compose ps | grep -v "Up"

# View recent alerts
curl -s http://localhost:9093/api/v1/alerts | grep -i "firing" || echo "No active alerts"
```

### Interactive Monitoring
```bash
# Real-time dashboard
/home/mills/collections/scripts/monitoring-dashboard.sh

# Security monitoring
/home/mills/collections/security/scripts/security-monitor.sh

# System cleanup (when needed)
/home/mills/collections/scripts/deep-cleanup.sh
```

cd collections/enhancements/advanced-alerting/
# Deploy alert-workflows.yml
```

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Common Issues & Solutions
```bash
# Service not responding
docker-compose restart [service-name]

# Disk space full
/home/mills/collections/scripts/deep-cleanup.sh

# Permission errors
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /home/mills/collections/

# Lost passwords
cat /home/mills/collections/security/credentials.txt

# Health check failures
/home/mills/collections/scripts/simple-health-check.sh --detailed
```

### Emergency Procedures
```bash
# Complete system reset (nuclear option)
docker-compose down
docker system prune -af
docker-compose up -d

# Restore from backup
cd /home/mills/collections/backup/
tar -xzf monitoring-stack-backup-latest.tar.gz
# Follow restoration procedures in operational-runbooks.md
```
