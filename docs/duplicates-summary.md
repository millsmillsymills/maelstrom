# Duplicates Summary

- Env templates: Reconciled `.env.example` â†’ `.env.template` (kept `.env.template`).
- Contributor docs: AGENTS.md provides a concise guide; for full workflow see CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Historical reports: Kept in `docs/archive/` to avoid mixing with active guides.

If additional duplicates are found, consolidate content into the canonical file and link from others.
