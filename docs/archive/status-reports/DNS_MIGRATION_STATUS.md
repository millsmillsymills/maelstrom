- [x] DNS resolution testing successful
- [x] Monitoring systems operational
- [x] Backup procedures prepared
- [x] Rollback scripts ready

### Migration Schedule (5 AM - 7 AM PT)
**4:30 AM** - Final health checks and notifications  
**5:00 AM** - Begin system DNS configuration updates  
**5:30 AM** - Validate migration and test failover  
**6:00 AM** - Performance monitoring and optimization  
**6:30 AM** - Comprehensive testing and documentation  
**7:00 AM** - Migration complete confirmation  

### Expected Benefits
- **Ad Blocking:** 90%+ reduction in advertising and tracking domains
- **Performance:** Faster DNS resolution with local caching
- **Security:** Malicious domain blocking and threat protection
- **Monitoring:** Comprehensive DNS query analytics
- **Redundancy:** Automatic failover between Pi-hole instances
