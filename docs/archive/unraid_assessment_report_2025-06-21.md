## Service Discovery Results

### üî¥ **CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES**

#### Exposed Network Services
```bash
‚úÖ HTTP (80):      Unraid Web Interface (with custom theme)
‚ùå HTTPS (443):    NOT CONFIGURED - No SSL/TLS encryption
‚úÖ SSH (22):       EXPOSED - Remote shell access available
‚úÖ SMB (445):      File sharing active
‚úÖ NetBIOS (139):  Legacy Windows networking
‚úÖ NFS (2049):     Network File System active
‚úÖ VNC (5900):     Remote desktop access EXPOSED
